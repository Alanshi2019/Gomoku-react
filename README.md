Gomoku:

Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. Also called Gobang or Five in a Row, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board with 25x25 (15x15) intersections.

The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


Tech Stack:

React - Open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML.

Redux - a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

Styled Components - a way to write CSS that's scoped to a single component, and not leak to any other element in the page.
